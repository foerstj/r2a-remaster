# R2A remaster

The original Return to Arhok map, remastered.

## What I did

This map is re-buildable and editable. I opened & saved every region in Siege Editor v1.7. The dsmap file can be rebuilt using the batch scripts, provided you have the folder structure of Dungeon Siege and TankCreator.
- Renamed the map so there are no conflicts with the original map.\
  The internal name is *world/maps/r2a*.\
  The generated file name is *Dungeon Siege/DSLOA/Return to Arhok.dsmap*.\
  The ingame name is *Return to Arhok (remastered)*.

## How to build

- Put TankCreator on the same folder level as your Dungeon Siege installation. Basically in the upper folder, you should have a "Dungeon Siege" folder, and a "TankCreator" folder.
- Put this repo as "Bits" into your personal Dungeon Siege LoA folder (where the savegames & screenshots are).
- Go into your Dungeon Siege installation folder and open CMD there.
- %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dungeon Siege LoA\Bits\build.bat

## Attribution

This map was created by Gas-Powered Games, not me. I'm just doing minor changes here.
