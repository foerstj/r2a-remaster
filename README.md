# R2A remaster

The original Return to Arhok map, remastered.

## What I did

This map is re-buildable and editable. I opened & saved every region in Siege Editor v1.7. The dsmap file can be rebuilt using the batch scripts, provided you have the folder structure of Dungeon Siege and TankCreator.
- Renamed the map so there are no conflicts with the original map.\
  The internal name is *world/maps/r2a*.\
  The generated file name is *Dungeon Siege/DSLOA/Return to Arhok.dsmap*.\
  The ingame name is *Return to Arhok (remastered)*.

## How to build

- Provide environment variables:
  - %DungeonSiege% - path to DS installation
  - %TankCreator% - path to TC installation
- Run the build.bat in the repo root

## Attribution

This map was created by Gas-Powered Games, not me. I'm just doing minor changes here.
